## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x: The application is written in Python, so you need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine. If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Streamlit: Streamlit is the framework used to develop this web application. You can install it using the following command:


pip install streamlit


- Pandas: Pandas is a powerful data analysis library used for manipulating and analyzing the stock data. You can install it using the following command:


pip install pandas


- Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library used to visualize the stock prices in an interactive chart. Install it using the following command:

shell
pip install matplotlib


## Installation

## Usage

1.  The data file should be in CSV format and contain columns for `Date` and `Price`. You can use your own data or find historical stock data from reliable sources like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.

2. Run the Streamlit application:


streamlit run app.py


3. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.
